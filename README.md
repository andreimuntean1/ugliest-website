# Ugliest website I've ever made
I actually made [Filip's](https://www.youtube.com/c/FilipDev) ugliest website [design](https://youtu.be/Dc7QtHkqBUc) into an actual website lol

## Compatibility
I tested the website on a 15.6" FHD screen. There might be some visual issues if this website is accessed from diffrent screen sizes.

This website is not mobile-friendly, and I won't waste my time to make it responsive, lol

It is supposed to look like this:
